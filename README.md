# Example crud

## Notes

### Arch style

> Please use any choice of architecture pattern â€“ either a standard server side rendered web-page or Web-Api that is used by JavaScript on the page.
> We would like to see if you can reason your choice.

SSR is used when:
- we need to make sure the website is easily accessible by clients without javascript (search engine bots for example)
- we want to reduce time it takes for users to see first content

CSR is used when:
- we want to minimize data sent over the network
- we want fast rendering after the initial load

We can use both approaches, so we SSR the initial page with some content and then use CSR to handle page navigation and other dynamic content.

In this assigment I used a simple SSR site with handlebars templates and a little bit of JS on the front-end to send forms because it's an admin panel that doesn't need extreme performance (not that it doesn't matter completely, but the focus should be on user facing apps), we don't have complex state to manage, it was faster to build.
